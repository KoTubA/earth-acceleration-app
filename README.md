## Project prupose

**Earth Acceleration App** is an application designed to assist students in conducting experiments in the Physics Laboratory. It facilitates the determination of Earth's acceleration (using a mathematical pendulum) and allows for the export of reports in PDF format. The project itself was created as part of an engineering project.
